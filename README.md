# Heart-Disease-Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

![](heart.jpg)

In that repository i used Cost complexity pruning that prune the tree.
Pruning in theory, should have the overfitting problem(High variance and low bias).so using pruning we can get a much more better result. 

Algorithm Used:
- Decision tree classifier
